# A customizable online dice roller

## Vision
This project aims to provide a fully customizable dice rolling app for use in
role playing games or other dice heavy hobbies. See list below for planned
features.

## Road map
- Main dice logic in place, should allow the user to roll any conceivable dice
and also create dice-sets of multiple identical dies.
- Fully functional graphical user interface. Most likely web based.
- The ability to save your game profile between sessions, most likely the
first iteration will be cookie based.
- Construct a back end that allows users to save their preferences to the
server.
